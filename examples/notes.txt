Improvements:
* Clean up UDPConnections so that IP address and ports can be specified via input file.
* Add soft real-time component for PITL.
* Actuators should have continuous states.
* Continuous-time integrator should step to the next discrete time.
* Actuators and planet should register phenomena in various domains (mechanical, magnetic field, radiation, power).
* Continuous-time dynamics should allow dynamical coupling.
* Create a serial PITL module?
* More examples, including a way to specify orbital elements instead of position and velocity. Does this imply a "parameter" field, as opposed to "constants" and "state"? Could "constants" include the notion of "parameters"?
* Derive immutable structs from mutable structs (macros) and convert after setup has completed.
* Implement SArrays and use with jitl, sitl, and pitl.
* Allow YAML files to start from other YAML files and then just override defaults.

whole_truth:
environment? what environment state is there?
cube1
  body
  sensors
    gyro
    star_tracker

measurement_bus: (always vehicle-specific)
sensors
  gyro
  star_tracker
actuators
  thruster1
  reaction_wheel1

command_bus:
software
  test_controller
actuators

Why not show me what measurements and commands look like on model creation, and then just allow `init` to return the initial state? Perhaps models will want to change their measurements or commands based on the "whole truth".

Interfaces:
-----------

init (add planet?)
----
body      t, constants, state, draws -> state
sensor    t, constants, state, draws, vehicle_truth -> state, measurement
actuator  t, constants, state, draws, vehicle_truth -> state, measurement, commands
software  t, constants, state -> state, inputs, outputs

derivatives
-----------
body      t, constants, state, draws, planet, forces

step
----
sensor    t, constants, state, draws, vehicle_truth, truth -> state
actuator  t, constants, state, draws, command, vehicle_truth, truth -> state
software  t, constants, state, measurements, my_inputs (read-only), outputs (read-only), all_inputs (write-only), commands (write-only) -> state, inputs, output, commands
body      t, constants, state, draws, planet -> truth

sense (don't these need to sense the planet?)
-----
sensor    t, constants, state, draws, vehicle_truth, truth
actuator  t, constants, state, draws, commands, vehicle_truth, truth

actuate
-------
t, constants, state, rand, command, vehicle_truth, truth

truth
-----
body
actuator

How do we decide what gets logged?
-> Maintain a list of signals to log, e.g.:
    /cube1/sensors/gyro (logs measurements)
    /cube1/sensors/gyro/w_BI_I (logs .../gyro/time, .../gyro/data/w_BI_B)
    /cube1/body/state (logs whole state as .../state/time, .../state/data/r_me_I, ...)
    /cube1/body/state/r_me_I (logs .../state/time, .../state/data/r_me_I, ...)
    /cube1/sensors/* (logs measurements)
    /*/sensors/* (logs measurements)
  -> This could be a vector of strings.

Can we automatically plot what gets logged?
-> This would be easy with HDF5's group exploration stuff.
-> Could use the spec above, too.
-> Difficult in Juno, which only has a single plot in the plot pane.
-> Difficult to specify custom setups. Probably best left to the user.

How do we allow actuators to have continuous states?
-> Break state up into continuous and dynamic components? This seems reasonable, since the variables are actually pretty different, but it requires two twos: one for discrete and one for continuous.
-> Keep them together, but return `nothing` for discrete fields as output of `derivatives`. This is tedious.
-> We can allow the discrete update to overwrite the continuous state if desired.

How do we make a consistent environment?
-> Make planet a Model?

Constructors could have arguments.
