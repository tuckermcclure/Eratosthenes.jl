Improvements:

* Add logging for everything and a way to specify what to log.
* Allow a section in a YAML file to start from another YAML file.
* Add examples.
* Add doc strings.

Bonus:

* Add soft real-time component for PITL.
* Create a serial PITL module?
* A way to specify orbital elements instead of position and velocity. Does this imply a "parameter" field, as opposed to "constants" and "state"? Could "constants" include the notion of "parameters"?
* Derive immutable structs from mutable structs (macros) and convert after setup has completed.
* Implement SArrays and use with jitl, sitl, and pitl.

Questions:

How do we decide what gets logged?
-> Maintain a list of signals to log, e.g.:
    /cube1/sensors/gyro (logs measurements)
    /cube1/sensors/gyro/w_BI_I (logs .../gyro/time, .../gyro/data/w_BI_B)
    /cube1/body/state (logs whole state as .../state/time, .../state/data/r_me_I, ...)
    /cube1/body/state/r_me_I (logs .../state/time, .../state/data/r_me_I, ...)
    /cube1/sensors/* (logs measurements)
    /*/sensors/* (logs measurements)
  -> This could be a vector of strings.

Can we automatically plot what gets logged?
-> This would be easy with HDF5's group exploration stuff.
-> Could use the spec above, too.
-> Difficult in Juno, which only has a single plot in the plot pane.
-> Difficult to specify custom setups. Probably best left to the user.
