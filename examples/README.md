Eratosthenes Examples
=====================

This directory contains several examples of creating vehicle simulations using Eratosthenes. They are intended to be run from this directory.

These examples may someday live in their own package, but for now, they're kept in the main Eratosthenes repository.

Subdirectories:

* scenarios: Scenario files used by the examples.
* utilities: Utilities that have nothing to do with Eratosthenes per se but are used in the examples.
* out: Where output files are stored.
