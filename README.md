[Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes) was a Greek guy who, among other space-related accomplishments, found an elegantly simple and remarkably accurate solution to estimating the circumference of the Earth. It's also the working title for an open-source, Julia-based spacecraft simulation environment that aims for simplicity while harnessing powerful underlying vehicle-modeling techniques. But while Eratosthenes, the guy, lives now only in our fond memories, Eratosthenes, the simulation project, is at its mere beginning and nowhere near ready for the public. Expect more in December of 2017!
